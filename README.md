Hi, my name is Soroush.

Passionate about the intersection of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, I am a dedicated and driven professional in the making. Currently pursuing an Accelerated BS/MS in Computer Science alongside a BS in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Stony Brook University, I thrive in environments where I can apply my strong analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and love for coding to address real-world problems.

With hands-on experience as a Software Engineering Co-op at Consolidated Edison Co. of NY, I have demonstrated a knack for improving operational efficiency and managing full software development lifecycle (SDLC) using agile methodologies. My academic projects showcase my abilities to successfully employ machine learning algorithms for prediction tasks, and to utilize advanced data analysis techniques for meaningful insights.

As an individual committed to continuous learning and improvement, I seek opportunities that will allow me to further hone my skills and make a positive impact on the technology landscape.
