Hi, my name is Soroush.

I always loved tinkering with electronics, and I am self-taught. Since the age of 13, I have been programming, starting with Arduino (C/C++) and later transitioning into Java, Python, C, and JavaScript. I am interested in continuing to learn and deliver high value to every team.

For the past 4 years, I have been working at Con Edison as a Software Engineering Co-op. I learned to work with processes involved in providing a utility to the public while developing programmatic solutions to streamline specific workflows. I currently manage many projects at the Company including the full redesign of the department's website.

While at Stony Brook, I was hired as a Research Assistant in Android App Security. I have learned how to detect security vulnerabilities in android applications and report them to developers. I was given credit in the Research Paper published on the COVID Exposure Notification Apps we analyzed.

Currently, I am pursuing an accelerated BS/MS in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science & a BS in Applied Mathematics/Statistics at Stony Brook University. I plan to graduate with my Bachelor's in Fall 2023 and my Masters in Fall 2024. I am seeking internship opportunities in the NYC area.
