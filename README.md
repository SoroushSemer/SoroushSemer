Hi, my name is Soroush.

I always loved tinkering with electronics, and I am self-taught. Since the age of 13, I converted an RC-control car to become more aware of its surroundings to drive on a line drawn on the ground. I am interested in continuing to learn and deliver high value to every team.

✔️ Throughout my high school career, I picked up Python and Arduino while learning RobotC, and LabVIEW at Brooklyn Tech. I did several exciting projects during this time, and I am very proud of Rubik's Cube Solving Robot in under 30 seconds.

✔️ From an academic perspective at Brooklyn Tech, I took AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Computer Science Principles plus college-level courses. I started at Stony Brook University as a Sophomore.

✔️ While at Brooklyn Tech, I was hired as an intern at Con Edison as an Engineering Aide. I learned to work with processes involved in providing a utility to the public while developing programmatic solutions to streamline specific workflows.

✔️ While at Stony Brook, I was hired as a research assistant in Android App Security. I am learning how to detect security culnerabilities in android applications.

Currently, I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science & Applied Mathematics/Statistics at Stony Brook University. I plan to graduate in May 2024. I am seeking internship opportunities in the NYC area.
